# dacort/is-remote

I'm now a remote employee. This is a new adventure for me and I thought it could be interesting to document my journey. 

I plan to keep this doc up-to-date with the equipment I use and challenges I face.

## Overview

I'm brand new to being remote - usually when I've done so before, it's just been out of a coffee shop with me and my laptop.
But with being fully remote I feel the need to upgrade some of my equipment.

I have an office basement (cold) with small windows (minimal sunlight) in Seattle (minimaler sunlight), so there are a variety of things I'm looking into to make my daily experience better. :smile:

I've purchased most of this on Amazon and have included relevant, but affiliate, links as an FYI.
